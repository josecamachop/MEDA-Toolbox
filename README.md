The Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis (MEDA) Toolbox in Matlab is a set of multivariate analysis tools for the exploration of data sets. 
There are several alternative tools in the market for that purpose, both commercial and free. The PLS_Toolbox from Eigenvector Inc. 
is a very nice example. The MEDA Toolbox is not intended to replace or being a competitor of any of these toolkits. Rather, the MEDA
Toolbox is a complementary tool which includes several of our recent contributions to the field. Thus, traditional exploratory plots 
based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS), such as score, loading and residual plots, are combined 
with new methods: MEDA, oMEDA, SVI plots, ADICOV, EKF & CKF crossvalidation, CSP, GPCA, SPLS crossvalidation, ASCA and VASCA .... 

The MEDA Toolbox can be used to analyze normal size data sets (several hundreds of observations times several hundreds of variables)
There is also an extension of the toolbox for large data sets, with millions of items, under folder toolbox/bigData. 

The MEDA Toolbox is expected to work on Octave.

<h2>Installation for Matlab (recommended)</h2>

1 - Download and extract (or git clone) in a directory of your choice <directory_path>

2 - Add to the MATLAB path the following directory with its subdirectories:

	- <directory_path>\toolbox

For step 2, in the MATLAB command line, you may use commands 'addpath' and 'genpath', e.g.: 

	>> addpath(genpath('<directory_path>\toolbox')) 

and then 'savepath'. You may alternatively use the 'pathtool' from the command line or the menu.

<h2> Standalone Installation</h2>

1 - Download and extract (or git clone) in a directory of your choice <directory_path>

2 - Run the excutable file MEDAIntaller.exe

<h2>Working with the MEDA Toolbox</h2>

To get started check the <a href="https://github.com/josecamachop/MEDA-Toolbox/edit/master/gettingStarted.mlx">gettingStarted.mlx</a> file at the root folder.

There are two ways to work with the MEDA toolbox: using the GUI (starting users) and using the commands (advanced users). The GUI is self 
explanatory. It incorporates helping messages to guide its use. To launch the GUI, type "MEDA" in the command line of Matlab after the 
installation. 

The commands provide of much more functionality. Each command includes helping information, that can be displayed by typing "help <command>" 
in the command line of Matlab. This helping information includes examples. Also, in the Examples directory, several real data examples 
are included. It is suggested to have a look at these examples.

There are two types of commands or routines. Those that do not provide visualization (e.g. meda, mspc, omeda, ...) are optimized for data 
computing. Those that issue a plot (e.g medaPca, medaPls, scoresPca, ...) are optimized for interactive scripting

Loading and Score plots in the toolbox are 2D scatter plots in the sub-space of the PCA or PLS model. Residual plots are line/bar plots
of the squared residuals of the variables/observations. Leverage plots are line/bar plots of the squared scores of the variables/observations.

MEDA plots are map plots that contain the relationship between each pair of variables. They look similar to correlation plots, but 
they present better properties for exploration.

oMEDA plots are bar plots that compute the differences between groups of observations in the latent subspace. They are similar to 
contribution plots but again with better properties.

SVI plots are useful to understand how a variable is related to the rest of the data set. The reading of the reference above is recommended.

ADICOV is a method to approximate a specific data distribution imposing a certain correlation structure. It is very useful for realistic data
simulation.

EKF and CKF are different versions of cross-validation in PCA, useful in some applications to infer an adequate number of PCs.

CSP are compressed versions of score plots, where millions of observations can be visualized thanks to clustering techniques.

GPCA is a PCA modification where loadings are constrain to one group of variables.

simuleMV is a simulation engine for multivariate data.

GPLS and GASCA are the GPCA extension to PLS and ASCA, respectively.

SDI is a procedure to find interesting subspaces in a PLS-DA model.

VASCA is a variable-selection version of ASCA.
