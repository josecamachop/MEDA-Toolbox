This folder contains the data and MATLAB scripts for an EDA example based on PLS. The data set 
was downloaded from http://michem.disat.unimib.it/chm/download/datasets.htm. It consists of 31 
antifilarial antimycin A1 analogues for which 53 physicochemical descriptors were calculated 
for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modelling. The set of descriptors is 
listed below:

Indices Descriptors

These descriptors are used for predicting in vitro antifilarial activity 
(-LOGEC50). This data set has been employed for testing variable selection methods.

The objective of this experiment is to illustrate that the MEDA framework can be used to
understand the data and as a valid means to perform non-automated variable selection.


Items in the folder:

- prepare_data.m: Script to prepare the data for analysis.

- selwood.mat: Data prepared for analysis. The file includes three MATLAB variables:

	- x: matrix 31x54 with the data. 

	- Obs: labels of the observations.

	- Vars: labels of the variables.

- selwood.xslx: csv file for the GUI.

- Script.mlx: Live script to perform the EDA using the MEDA Toolbox commands. To run the script, the 
	current directory should be the one where the script is stored.
